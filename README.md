This JavaScript file handles the API requests and dynamically displays the results.

The searchPokemon function asynchronously fetches data from the Pok√©API.
The toTitleCase function ensures Pok√©mon names are properly formatted.
The displayPokemon function generates HTML to display the fetched Pok√©mon data.

## Troubleshooting
Timeout Error: If the API request times out, ensure your internet connection is stable and try again.
Invalid Pok√©mon: Ensure that you are typing the correct name or ID. Pok√©mon names are case-insensitive but must be correct.
